This is another simple CURD APP, which shows Curd app functions. I Used ReactJS for Frontend. NodeJS & Express for backend. For the Database I used MYSql. This app shows we can create a form and add, delete, and update the records. We can use this sort of curd function in any website or app. 
Here is a demo of this App. Click play to see the demo.
